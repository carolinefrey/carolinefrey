## Caroline Frey

### About
* I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science
* I started teaching myself iOS Development in 2022 (April)
* I was a member of the HankoAcademy Fall 2022 Cohort - a 10-week bootcamp that focuses on developing a foundational understanding of iOS concepts.

    #### Topics Covered in Bootcamp Include:
    * UIKit and programmatic UI
    * Auto Layout
    * UITableView & UICollectionView
    * Protocol Oriented Programming
    * Delegation Pattern
    * iOS Design Patterns (MVC, MVVM)
    * Memory Management
    * Persistance
    
### Notable Projects
Note: All projects are built using 100% programmatic UI (no storyboards!)
* Werdd - Using a "words" API, users can search word definitions, save their favorite words and generate random words to explore their definitions.
    * [Werdd Repo](https://github.com/carolinefrey/Werdd)
    * Frameworks include UIKit, Core Data, Alamofire
    * While developing this app I learned how to implement UI programmatically, how to make network requests, how to parse and display JSON, how to implement UITableView and how to persist data using Core Data.
* JobApp Tracker - Users can keep track of their job applications.
    * [JobApp Tracker Repo](https://github.com/carolinefrey/JobTracker)
    * Frameworks include UIKit and Core Data
    * While developing this app I learned how to implement delegates and protocols, how to allow for cell reordering in a UICollectionView, how to persist that custom reordering using Core Data and how to filter collection view data.

### Currently...
* I am currently working on HealthDash an app that integrates with HealthKit to display a summary of a user's key metrics for the day (sleep, weight, active energy and steps)
    * [HealthDash Repo](https://github.com/carolinefrey/HealthDash)
